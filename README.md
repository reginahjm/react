# "React" Assignment II

I did quick user testing on my 'math game' and I noticed people cares about the visual part 
and they talk about the functionality. 
they first asked it is good to have context in the center, but some people wanted 
more visual design. 
and then, they gave me feedback on entering more examples, and wish to choose 
levels in the math game
